EXAMPLE: Find the frecuenci of the word "the" ina  given text

/the/
/[tT]he/	theology
/\b[Tt]he\b/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the word the when has some undersoceres or numbres like the_ or the22
We need to specify that we want instances when there is no alphabethic letter on either side of the 'the':

/[^a-zA-z][Tt]he[^a-zA-Z]/ : But the proble is it won't find 'the' when it is at the bigining.

/(^|[^a-zA-Z])[tT]he([^a-zA-z]|$)/
