# TUTORIALS FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION

The main idea is to build a Neural Network to detect Vowels. With this we want to recognize vowels in 2-letter syllables in order to segment the vowel from the letter and thus get its PHONEME representation. By using this strategy of vowel-based  ALIGNMENT we want to be able to segment further the words and create HUGE DATASETS of all the PHONEMS from spanish languague. Lastly we'll be training a Deep Neural Network to recognize all the phonems of Spanish speech audios
