The problem of automatic speech recognition (ASR) is that given a set of audio
records containing speech, system can obtain the transcripts from these records.
The general ASR system consists of three components:
• Feature Extraction: component dedicated to extracting information from raw
audio recordings
• Language Model (LM): component in charge of modelling the grammatical
structure of the language
• Acoustic Model (AM): component in charge of computing the relationship between
audio features and linguistic units such as phonemes
